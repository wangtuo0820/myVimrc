# QML syntax file for VIM

I take absolutely no credit for this - all I did was write the ftdetect line and package it.

The actual syntax highlight file was done by Warwick Allison and subsequent work by the [contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) without whom this would not be possible.

## How to use
I strongly suggest you use one of the excellent bundle managers or add it as a submodule under your bundle directory.

Enjoy,
